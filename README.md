This repository contains a simple Java program demonstrating a common error: ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The bug is caused by an off-by-one error in the for loop's condition.  The solution demonstrates how to fix this by changing the loop condition to `< arr.length` instead of `<= arr.length`.  This example highlights the importance of carefully considering loop bounds when working with arrays.
